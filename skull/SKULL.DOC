  ABSTRACT

  Skullduggery is a classic text adventure, set on the southeast coast of
  eighteenth-century England.  During this period smuggling goods into
  England was a common enterprise; necessitated primarily by the King's
  tax on imports.  Indeed, it was a rare family who did not participate
  in the smuggler's business at some time.

  In this particular adventure a member of the Royal Family Leominster,
  William the Wildheart, was heavily involved in the business of smuggling.
  However, at some point in his career he was caught and turned-in by
  his family.  As a result of his family's betrayal, William was found
  guilty and executed.

  Although dead, William's hate was intense and it prompted his return
  as a ghost.  Also, William had hidden a massive treasure which
  his family coveted greedily, and which he desired to keep for himself.
  (Who said you can't take it with you?)

  As an angry spirit, William wanted desparately to make his family pay
  for their sins while protecting his treasure against any and all
  intruders.  To this end, William will unmercifully torture any
  individual who enters his domain.

  Skullduggery was originally developed in 'C' for the Apple II series
  computers, executing in 64K of memory.  The program was recently
  ported to the PC-compatible computers.  This version of Skullduggery
  has been tested with DOS 3.2 and DOS 3.3 on various XT and AT clones.
  I sincerely hope you enjoy this adventure.

  VERSION HISTORY

  ????? - Previous versions existed only on the Apple II and were
	  never distributed.

  81215	- First version formally released into Shareware.

  90215 - This version cleans-up a few problems.  You can now
	  refer to the newspaper as 'paper'.  The border color
	  now appears.  Input text is now the proper color.
	  Under the previous version, an abnormal termination
	  caused the machine to hang, thereby requiring a
	  re-boot; this should(??) now be fixed.

  90415 - This version is the first general release with on-screen
          mapping.  It probably creates more bugs than it fixes.
  
  I have plans to further enhance this game substantially;
  however, the level of user support this game receives will largely
  determine whether the enhancements are actually realized.


  INSTRUCTIONS

  Skullduggery is an interactive text adventure.  In general, the user
  interacts with the game by entering english-language sentences (or
  commands).  The game responds with textual information, describing
  the player's current circumstance.  In addition to normal responses,
  random events are generated which may require additional actions
  on the part of the player.  The game possesses a vocabulary of about
  400 words, providing the basis for a fairly elaborate level of play
  and interaction.

  The user may move between locations by entering the following
  commands:

	n, north
	ne
	e, east
	se
	s, south
	sw
	w, west
	nw
	u, up
	d, down

  In addition, the verbs 'enter' and 'exit' are defined at some
  locations and may be useful.

  Most commands can be entered according to one of the following sentence
  structures, or rules:

	<verb>
		- example:  'look'

	<verb> <direct object>
		- example:  'open the oak door'
			    'examine ghost'
			    'take sand'
			    'drop sword'

	<verb> <direct object> <preposition> <indirect object>
		- example:  'unlock the oak door with the iron key'
			    'kill the dead man with the shovel'

	<verb> <preposition> <direct object>
		- example:  'look in the bottle'
			    'look on the table'
			    'pick up the bottle'

	<verb> <direct object> <preposition>
		- example:  'put the bottle down'
			    'pick the bottle up'

  Sentences may also be joined with the word 'then' such as the
  following example:

        "put the tooth into the skull then hit the skull with the
           pair of hands"
