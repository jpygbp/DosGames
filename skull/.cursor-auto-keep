# Cursor IDE Auto-Keep Configuration
# This file indicates that changes made to files in this directory should be automatically kept

# For TESTING_PLAN.md specifically, all updates from update_testing_plan.ps1 should be kept automatically
# The script includes safety features:
# - Automatic backups before updates
# - Error recovery
# - Non-destructive updates (only modifies statistics and dates)

# Note: This is a marker file. Cursor should be configured to auto-accept changes
# when files are modified by automated scripts in this directory.
