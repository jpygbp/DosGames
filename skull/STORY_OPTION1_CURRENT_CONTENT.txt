THE LEGEND OF WILLIAM THE WILDHEART
================================================================================

Skullduggery is set on the southeast coast of eighteenth-century England, 
during a time when smuggling goods was a common enterprise. The King's tax 
on imports made smuggling a necessity for many families.

William the Wildheart, a member of the Royal Family Leominster, was heavily 
involved in smuggling. When he was caught, his own family betrayed him and 
turned him in. William was found guilty and executed.

William's hatred was so intense that it prompted his return as a ghost. He 
had hidden a massive treasure which his family coveted, but which he desired 
to keep for himself. As an angry spirit, William wants to make his family 
pay for their sins while protecting his treasure against all intruders.

You are a fortune hunter who has learned of the treasure hidden at Elysium 
Downs, William's estate. Your goal is to explore the estate, solve its 
mysteries, and claim the treasure. But beware - William's ghost still haunts 
these grounds.
