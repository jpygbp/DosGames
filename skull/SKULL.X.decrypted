Shadows begin to form around you, dancing hither and yon; giving you a dizzying sensation.  You feel a pressure around your throat, but you still can't see anything.  The pressure tightens until finally, in stark terror you realize your mouth is drenched in blood....#It's too dark to see.#@Suddenly you are gripped by an intense chill in the air; the chill seems to hang-on for a time and then it slowly subsides.#@Suddenly, a shrill cackling echos through the mansion walls.#@Music from a spinet begins to echo throughout the mansion.

Yo' watch thou step young lad, fo' life be prolific with cutthroats and thieves; all the better to grab yo' booty fo' thee".  With that, the mouth stops its animated motion, leaving silence in its wake.#Only an imbecile would try to %s that.#You become light-headed and finally collapse under the effects of the beverage. Out of the depths of your consciousness you dream about secret passageways that wander throughout the mansion, and intricately carved moulding that turns at the touch of a human hand.  The dream fades and you awaken, an intense aching in your skull....#You get drunk and collapse under the intoxicating effects.  A dream comes into focus and you see yourself stooped next to a dead body; your hand is raised high above your head, grasping a blurred object.  With a wild-eyed look on your face, you bring the object down, driving it into the corpse.  The dream fades and you awaken; a merciless throbbing in your head...#The intoxicating beverage is potent, and it knocks you out quickly.  Out of the depths of your mind a dream comes into focus.  You are on a ship out at sea, riding the waves like the pirates you remember hearing about as a kid.  As the skipper of this vessel, you have your hands on the wheel; steering a precise course toward your destination.  As you turn the wheel, a magnificent treasure appears before you -- the riches are beyond belief.  Suddenly your eyes are open and you're awake, your mouth is dry as a desert and you feel a pounding in your head...#The intoxicating beverage hits you like a gang of plow horses.  You weave back and forth and finally collapse under its weight.  Out of the depths of your mind a dream begins to form....  You are standing before a large marble altar, holding a dead man over your shoulder.  A raging inferno surrounds you, its flames licking at the altar.  As you look up at the altar, you raise the body above your head; a blood-curdling scream comes from your lips.  Shaking with the effort, you place the corpse on the altar.....  The dream fades and you awaken to the reality of a pounding headache and a parched mouth.#You watch in amazement as the %s passes through your intended victim.#@The boatman pushes off from the shore.

The fire roars on for a time, creating tremendous, swirling gusts of heat.  Finally, the inferno's intensity diminishes as the fire recedes; leaving a small pile of ashes sitting on the altar.#@The boatman's head rises and you see a grizzled, old man with a toothy grin peering at you from beneath the robe's hood.  The boatman extends his hand in your direction - like he expects you to give him something.#The boatman acknowledges with a wide, toothy smile.  He takes the %s and stuffs it under his robe.#The %s ignores the gift.#@You turn around and watch the dinghy fade away to nothing, taking the boatman with it.#@A chill descends -- suddenly a shimmering white light in the shape of a man seems to step-out from nowhere.  As you watch, the shape glares back at you. The ghost's lips are moving and it seems to be forming words; but no sound emerges.#@The ghost raises an arm; his hand points in your direction.#@A long sword appears in the ghost's hands.  The ghost is upon you quickly, the sword raised high.  You watch in stunned disbelief as the sword slices through the air, heading toward you.  Suddenly, you are looking at a headless corpse; laying on the ground across from you.  Blood is gushing from the stub, forming a red pool.  As darkness descends, you realize the headless body is your own.#@The glow diminishes as the shape recedes into the shadows...#@A violent wind arises, creating swirling gusts of debris.  You watch as the %s begins to shake, the vibrations increasing in intensity.#@The %s lifts into the air, elevated by the swirling winds.  It almost seems like it is taking aim at you.#@Suddenly, the %s flies through the air and crashes into you; crushing you into the ground and shattering your bones.  Darkness descends as you enter the world of hereafter.#The swirling gusts of wind subside until only a peaceful calm remains; the %s settles back to the ground.#@You hear a rustling sound behind you.  You turn to see the %s raise itself off the floor.  Its face is a mask of death as it glares at you.#@The %s begins to take halting steps toward you, reaching out with its hands. As it steps closer, you back away from it.  The faceless mask of death glares in your direction.#@Suddenly, you feel a confining wall behind you.  In the same moment, you feel the hands of the %s close around your neck.  The hands grow tighter, causing your windpipe to collapse and crushing your neck.#@The %s slows its halting steps; swaying back and forth.  Finally, it crashes to the ground; its glaring mask of death recedes....#@Out of the corner of your eye, you catch a glimpse of slight movement.  You turn to find that the %s has moved closer to you.#@The %s begins to walk toward you; taking deliberate, balanced steps.  As it steps forward, you back away; watching its arms reach out to you.#@Slowly, deliberately, the %s stalks toward you.  Suddenly, you feel a confining wall behind you.  In the same moment, you feel its hands close around your neck.  The iron jaws grow tighter, crushing your throat in their grasp.  Consciousness recedes as you feel the sharp, strangling pain in your windpipe.#@The %s stops its slow, deliberate movement.  Abruptly, it turns and shuffles back to its position.#@Suddenly, the eyes of %s open; they stare at you with a deep, penetrating gaze.#@The eyes remain fixed on you, as the %s comes to its feet.  Slowly, it approaches.  You try to back away but find there's nowhere to go.#@Suddenly the %s is upon you, and you feel its teeth biting into your neck. You feel your jugular severed by the razor-sharp fangs, and realize that your blood is being devoured in huge gulps.  Your feet start to slip from beneath you.  Finally, you slouch to the earth; a drained and withered corpse.#@Suddenly the %s halts as a look of pained disbelief comes over its face. Without warning it collapses to the ground.#@Without warning, a feeling of peaceful calm intrudes on you.  A shimmering glow appears, expanding into the shape of a beautiful, yet dignified, woman. The shape looks at you intently, you can make out a smile on her face.#@The ghost raises her arms toward you; she seems to be motioning you toward her.  The beauty in her eyes attracts you; drawing you closer to her.#@The ghost brings her hand to her mouth, seeming to blow a kiss toward you. Without warning the silhouette fades; leaving behind a peaceful calm.#@You notice that it seems to be getting darker; nighttime is approaching.#@The darkness is closing in; night will be upon you soon.#@The darkness is moving closer; the sun is about to set.#@The dark of night is upon you.

It should help you in the search for treasure.#As you emerge, you notice that the dark of the night is here.  All around, you can feel the anguish of tortured spirits hiding in the darkness.@#As you emerge, you notice that the light of day is here; it will help in your search for treasure.@#@Out of the corner of your eye you notice a slight movement in the cage.#@The skeleton's head lifts away from the bars and looks out at you with a baleful stare.  The skeleton's teeth open, emitting a deep gutteral tone.  The skeleton says, "beware the bones, its hand may unlock the dungeon of thieves; but it kills with equal ease..."#@The skull glares hauntingly through the bars.  All at once a look of pained anguish contorts the face of the skeleton.  The skull slumps onto the bars, its, pained expression fading to oblivion.#@A soft shimmering light intrudes on the darkness as your hazy vision comes into focus......@#@Suddenly the Grim Reaper emerges from the roaring inferno, his sickle slung over his shoulder.  The Reaper's deep voice intrudes on your consciousness: "The ghost of William has evaded me for a long time.  He watches over his treasure, killing those who attempt to find it; but he himself, will not come to his resting place.  You must solve the mysteries surrounding the treasure; only then will he come to the death which is his."  With a gloating laugh, the Reaper fades into the darkness.@#@A shimmering glow appears; hanging in the centre of the cavern. "At last", the words are exclaimed in your mind.  "You have solved the mysteries of my treasure.  From henceforth you shall guard the treasure, protecting it from fortune hunters around the world."  A cackling laugh echos in your mind, as the glow fades into the shadows.....#@@    ***** To be continued *****#The pile of debris blocks your path.#The hole is too high for you to reach.#The swirling waters would bury you.#You blindly thrash around the roaring inferno and return to the altar.#The cavern wall blocks your path.#You would fall to your death.#You must specify a compass direction here.#The opening is too small.#The fireplace is too narrow for climbing.#The floor is too dirty to kiss.#The door is closed.#The cliffs block your path.#If you bend down far enough, you can kiss yourself goodbye.#As you attempt to gain a handhold, the dirt breaks loose.#Only a ghost can fly.#A spiritual force blocks your path.#You put face to the ground and kiss the earth.#There's a wrought-iron fence blocking your path.#There's no place to exit here.#There's no place to enter here.#Does this game get you down?#If you climbed the tree, you would fall and break your neck.#Only a ghost can walk through the wall.#The bushes are too thick to enter.#There's a monument in the way.#You walk into a deep marsh and turn back.#You can't walk through the wall.#The cliffs are too steep; you would plunge to your death.#The ocean waves would bury you.#The terrain is too rugged for walking.#There's a floor blocking your path.#There's a ceiling in your way.#There's a wall in your way.#The dirt road goes on forever.#Only a ghost can walk through the fence.#The forest is too thick to enter.#Underground Tunnel.#You are in a damp underground tunnel.  The tree roots growing across the tunnel make passage very difficult here.  The tunnel heads off to the northeast and  seems to widen as you proceed to the southwest.  A hole is embedded in the ceiling above you.#Dirt Road.#You are on a dirt road which runs southwest to northeast.  To the north and west there is a dense, dark forest.#Edge of the Forest.#You are on the fringe of a dark forest.  A path leads away to the northwest.#Shack Entrance.#You are standing outside a broken-down shack.  A path winds away to the southeast and intersects an east-bound trail.#Shack.#This is an old, broken-down shack.  There is a deep covering of dust on the floor and cobwebs hang from the walls and ceiling.  The floor creaks loudly as you walk.#Lonely Grave.#You are standing in front of a lonely grave, marked with a stone cross.#Tomb.#You can feel the darkness that possesses this room; such an eerie feeling might be from the cold, damp floor and stone walls.  Or it might be the shadows dancing in the background, flickering in unison with your light. A granite coffin occupies the centre of the chamber.#Cavern of Jewels.#You have entered a dimly-lit cavern, with multi-coloured jewels embedded in the walls.  The colouring of the jewels emit a soft radiance, playing on the varied shapes of rock walls to create animated silhouettes throughout the cavern. The large quantity of precious jewels, in all their varied shapes and sizes, make up a large and priceless treasure; fit for all the kings through the  ages.  A trap door is embedded in the cavern's ceiling.#Recessed Entrance.#You are at a recessed section of the wrought-iron fence.  It turns out that this is an entrance to a large estate.  Next to the gate there's a plaque embedded in the fence.  A dirt road leads away to the northeast.#Northwest Corner.#You are outside the northwest corner of a wrought-iron fence which leads off to the south and east.  Inside, the fence is lined with high, thick bushes; making it impossible to see onto the estate grounds.#Top of the Cliff.#You are at the top of a cliff, overlooking a fog-bound beach to the south.  The smell of salt hangs thick in the air; and you can hear the waves crashing onto the beach below.  Through the thick fog you can make out the shape of a ship's mast.  There is a wrought-iron fence to the east and a path winds away to the north.#Eastern Fence.#You are outside a wrought-iron fence, running east-to-west.  To the west you can see a recess in the fence.  As you look eastward, you see that the fence continues into a clump of bushes.#Clump of Bushes.#You are at a clump of bushes, which turns out to be the northeast corner of the wrought-iron fence.  The fence runs off to the west, and leads into a forest to the south.#Inside of the Bushes.#You are inside the clump of bushes; with foliage so thick that you can't see outside.  On the ground, there is a wooden trap door.#Driveway by the Shack.#This is a spot just inside the wrought-iron gate.  A dirt driveway lined with huge trees, winds off to the south.  To the east is a small guard shack.#Guard Shack.#There's a strong, musty odor here.  With cobwebs hanging from the ceiling and mouse tracks running across the dusty floor, it's apparent that the house has been abandoned for some time.#Drive by the Monument.#The tree-lined drive runs north and south, with a monument on the eastern side of the road.  To the south you can make out the shape of a large building through the trees.  An intersecting drive leads off to the west.#Drive Intersection.#Here, a north-south drive intersects with a tree-lined driveway running east and west.  To the southeast there is an opening in the trees.  Through the opening you can see a stone mansion which appears very large, even at this distance.#Stable Entrance.#This is the main entrance to a large, dilapidated stable.  A tree-lined driveway leads off to the north and there are tall bushes to the east.  Beyond the bushes you can see a massive stone mansion.#Subterranean Passage.#You are in a dark subterranean passage.  Squeaky sounds and the pattering of little feet pervade the darkness around you.  A large passage runs north and south here, and a small tunnel leads down to the east.#Cemetery Entrance.#This is the entrance to a cemetery; bounded by a tall, wrought-iron fence.  As you peer through the entranceway you can see a foreboding stone building.  In a far corner of the cemetery you can make out the shape of a number of gravestones.#Cemetery.#You are inside the cemetery; somehow, it feels eerie and cold here.  To the west there is a stone mausoleum with a massive iron door.  A south-bound path leads to an area of gravestones.#Graveyard.#This section of the cemetery is very cold.  A number of the family's graves stand here; arranged in several neat rows and marked by stone tablets.  A stone monument marks the end of a winding, eastbound path.  Gazing over your surroundings, you find your eyes being drawn to a grave on the edge of the yard; covered in a thick stand of grass and marked by an ancient stone cross.#Mausoleum.#You are inside the mausoleum; a large, stately tomb permeated by cold and dampness.  A marble coffin sits against the northern wall and the southern wall is occupied by a granite coffin.  The far corner is lined with a wall made of beautiful, pure-white marble; with a large slab of granite leaning against it. An iron door opens to the east.#Stable.#You are inside a dilapidated stable.  There are several stalls for animals here; but they are empty.  There's a main entrance to the north and a side door opens to the east.#Stable Side Entrance.#This is the east side of the stable. To the south there is a cliff which provides a view of the fog-bound beach below.  A path leads eastward to a massive stone mansion; to the west, a doorway opens into the stable.#Service Entrance.#You are standing at a large, utilitarian doorway that was probably used as a service entrance.  To the south you can see the edge of a cliff which overlooks the beach below.  A path leads off to the west.#End of the Driveway.#This is the end of a tree-lined drive, leading off to the east.  A garden shed sits on the north side of the drive.#Shed.#You are inside an old, broken-down shed; which must have been used for the storage of gardening tools.#Styx River, South.#You are on the southern edge of the Styx river.  To the south, you can see the shoreline and subterranean cove.  As you gaze to the north, you see a wide expanse of river before you.  The river flows gently here, caressing and soothing you in its wake.#Dark Forest.#You are surrounded by a dense, dark forest; with thick bushes all around.  A trap door is embedded in the ground.#Front of the Mansion.#You are in front of a massive granite mansion; a monument to the accumulation of excessive wealth.  Interestingly, the granite seems to give off a mellow golden hue.  Stone steps lead up to a large ornamental entrance.  To the west, a tree-lined drive winds away and a path leads off to the east.#Mansion Entrance.#You are standing at a large ornamental entrance, decorated with beautifully detailed figures and a large, intricately carved, oak door.  However, much of the artwork is buried in cobwebs which have spun their own unique and varied shapes.#Garden.#This must have been a beautiful garden at one time; although the flower beds have long overgrown with weeds and only a few wild flowers remain.  An eastbound path leads into a dark, haunting forest.  To the west, a large set of garden doors open into the mansion.#Patio.#This is a patio on the south side of the mansion, bounded to the west by a stone wall made up of beautifully carved figures.  From here you can look down onto a beach, buried in a thick fog.  Old stone steps lead down the cliffs.#Beach.#This is a sandy section of beach.  You can't help but notice that the colour of the sand is pure white.  As you listen to waves crash on the beach, you notice the distinctive smell of the salty ocean.  Peering westward through the fog you can make out the shape of a ship's mast.  Old stone steps lead up the cliffs from here.#Western Beach.#The beach begins to turn rocky here; in fact, the rocks make it impossible to go further.  Through the fog you can see cliffs to the north; they seem quite tall.  There is a ship run aground here; a speedy-looking cutter, which could have been used by smugglers to transport their booty across the channel.#Eastern Beach.#This is a rocky section of beach; which turns to sand as you follow the beach to the west.  To the east the terrain appears to be more and more rugged; and the north is blocked by tall cliffs, with large rocks protruding from the cliff's base.  The fog is quite soupy here, making it difficult to see; but the salty air provides a freshness you won't soon forget.#Rocks.#You are on top of the rocks at the base of the cliffs.  Somehow, the air feels quite calm here; maybe because you're so close to the cliffs.  A crevice provides an entrance into the cliffs here.#Subterranean Entrance.#This is a damp underground cavern.  You can see light coming from a crevice above you; a passage leads off to the north.#Subterranean Passage.#You are in a dark passage; as near as you can tell the passage leads off to the east.  To the west, you can see an opening in a granite wall.#Dark Forest.#You are surrounded by a dense, dark forest; with thick bushes all around.#Dark Forest.#You are surrounded by a dense, dark forest; with thick bushes all around.#Dark Forest.#You are surrounded by a dense, dark forest; with thick bushes all around.#Dark Forest.#You are surrounded by a dense, dark forest; with thick bushes all around.#Rolling Meadow.#You are in a large meadow, with slightly rolling hills of green.  A thick forest surrounds the meadow, its haunting darkness staring back at you.#Cargo Hold.#You are in the cargo hold of the ship.  You can hear the sounds of small squeaky animals scurrying about; but the shadows shelter them from your view.#Animal Trap.#You have fallen into a deep, wide hole, with dirt sides extending up to the top. Clearly, it was designed to trap wild animals as they roamed through the forest.#Animal Trap.#You have fallen into a deep, wide hole, with dirt sides extending up to the top. Clearly, it was designed to trap wild animals as they roamed through the forest.#Rolling Meadow.#You are in a large meadow, with slightly rolling hills of green.

A stairway leads up from here and passages lead off to the north and south.#Wine Cellar.#This is a dark wine cellar, with large wooden wine racks lining the walls.  The racks are full with many and varied shaped wine bottles.#Laboratory.#This room is rife with cobwebs.  A table is here with various bottles, flasks and other laboratory paraphernalia.#Smuggler's Lair.#You are in a damp cellar, with granite walls all around.  This place looks as though it could have been used as a hideout.  On the east wall some granite blocks have been removed, revealing a dark opening beyond.  A stairway leads up from here and a passage leads off to the south.#Torture Chamber.#You are in an old torture chamber.  From the looks of the rack and other obscene implements, it appears that the torturers had quite a time; much of the equipment is caked with layers of dried blood and rotten flesh.  In the far corner you see a dark opening, cloaked in layers of dust and cobwebs.  An iron maiden occupies the western wall of the chamber.#Dungeon.#You are in a dark, damp dungeon; surrounded by walls made of stone.  A small, armoured door opens to the north.#Foyer.#You are in a large foyer with a high, ornamental ceiling.  A stairway lined with a handrail of beautifully carved figures, descends from a second floor balcony.  Above a stately fireplace there is a tabard, blazoned with the family's coat of arms.

A mahogany side table sits next to a finely carved sofa; and a fireplace is embedded in the western wall.  Arched doorways lead off to the west and south.#Conservatory.#Richly carved moulding and paneling surrounds a fireplace on the north wall of this room.  The remaining walls are lined with bookcases containing beautifully-bound novels.

A spinet is here, surrounded by sofa and chairs; and a fireplace occupies the north wall. Doors open into a garden to the east.#Dark Tunnel.#You are in a dark tunnel.  Interestingly, it feels rather warm here; like the air is being heated from below.  A faint rumbling sound intrudes on the silence; and as you touch the rock wall, you can feel a slight vibration.  A wide passage leads up to the west and a steep, narrow tunnel descends to the south.#Western Great Hall.#You are in the western part of the great hall.  A spiral staircase, adorned with intricate carvings, descends from an upstairs balcony.  The doric pilasters are particularly prominent here, blending with the carved cornice to create a magnificent chamber.

A decorated ceiling blends splendidly with the overmantel, above the fireplace.#Styx River, Central.#You are in the centre of the Styx river.  The cavern ceiling is very high here, making is seem almost like a cloudy day.  To the south, you can make out the subterranean cove in the distance.  Northward, a wide expanse of river runs past the shoreline of a cavern; the high ceiling making it seem distant and insignificant.  The flowing river washes by, licking at the dinghy.#Kitchen.#You are in the kitchen; where the cook slaved over the kitchen table, making various dishes to delight the palate.  A fireplace occupies the eastern wall, with a large black kettle hanging above it.  Doorways lead to the north and west; a utility door opens to the south.#Still Room.#This is the room where spice and medicine preparation took place.  Against the north wall there is a table with a large cupboard beside it.#Inferno.#You are in a centre of a raging inferno; with intense, swirling heat all around you.  The rumbling is dominant here, masking all other sounds.  A large marble altar is standing here, oblivious to the heat and flames that lick at its surface.#Subterranean Cliffs.#This is the end of a steep tunnel.  To the east, the tunnel opens out to a subterranean cliff, overlooking a massive cavern.  Looking out over the cliffs you can see the source of the rumbling; a blazing inferno covering the eastern side of the cavern.  Even at this distance, the hot air sweeps across your face; baking your flesh.#Dining Room.#This is the formal dining room; a chamber of prominent grandeur.  The large mahogany table and chairs dominate a room appointed with detailed crown moulding, elegant walnut wainscotting, and a stately fireplace.#Guest Parlour.#You are in the guest parlour, a richly appointed chamber with exquisite furnishings.  The sofa and chairs are upholstered in fine fabric and surround a fireplace of stately appeal; the overmantel blending beautifully with a decorated ceiling and crown moulding.#End of the West Hall.#This is the end of a hallway which leads off to the west.  As you look along the hall, you can't help but notice the elegant silk and paintings that adorn the walls.  From here, doorways open to the north, south, and east.#Hall at the Foyer.#You are in an east-west hallway, with walls decorated in silk and paintings.

There is a wooden panel on the north wall; and a lever next to the panel.#Sitting Room.#This is the lady's sitting room.  The room is in shambles, with furnishings torn from the walls and strewn about.  It looks like someone ransacked the room, perhaps looking for something valuable.#Secret Landing.#This is a dark stairway landing, with narrow stairs leading up and down. On the south wall you see a wooden panel; next to the panel is a lever.#Lady's Bedroom.#You are in the Lady's bedroom; a richly appointed room with a large, elegant four-poster bed.  A fireplace, embedded in a wall of mahogany paneling, provides a finishing touch to the subdued, peaceful chamber.  Doors lead to the north, northwest, and west.#Parlour.#This is a comfortably decorated parlour; set aside for quiet moments between the Lady and Master.  Elegantly upholstered furniture create a feeling of peaceful relaxation.#Inferno's Edge.#You are near the blazing inferno; a massive fire covering the eastern side of the cavern.  The heat is intense here, baking your flesh in its swirling gusts of wind.  From behind the inferno you can hear screams of terror, muffled by the rumbling.  As your eyes scan the cavern, you see distant cliffs to the north and west.  To the south, you can see the distant line of the Styx river. An iron plaque is embedded in the north wall; overlooking a large granite rock which occupies the centre of the cavern.#Master's Bedroom.#This is the Master's bedroom; a room of subdued grandeur appointed with finely crafted crown moulding and rich paneling.  The fireplace and large, comfortable bed enhance the peacefulness of the room.#Guest Bedroom.#This is a large, tastefully decorated bedroom containing a comfortable, four-poster bed.  A fireplace adorned with an exquisite overmantel completes the restful chamber.#Gallery.#You are in a large gallery, containing rows of beautiful paintings and portraits.

The carved figures in the rail combine with the decorated ceiling to create a feeling of expansive grandeur.

A doorway opens to the south.#Stairway Landing.#You are on the second floor in the back stairwell.  Stairs lead both up and down from here, and a hallway leads off to the east.  The stairs leading up have been blocked by a large pile of debris, apparently the result of some battered upstairs walls.#Hall at West Gallery.#You are in a north-south hallway, with walls decorated in silk and paintings. Doors open to the east and west.#NW Hall Intersection.#This is the northwest corner of a tastefully decorated hallway; where an east-bound hall intersects a south-bound hall.  A doorway leads to the north.#Cavern.#You are in the centre of a massive cavern; where the walls are emitting a soft glow to light your way.  Distant rumbling sounds intrude on the silence; the rumbling seems to coincide with the vibrations in the stone floor.  The cavern is quite warm; almost too warm.  Scanning the cavern, you see the Styx river, running from the northwest to southeast.  Gazing off to the north you can see a distant fire, raging out of control.#Fore deck.#This is the fore deck of the cutter.  A main mast protrudes from the deck and the sails are rolled around the boom.  To the south, you can follow the deck to the ship's aft.#Styx River, North.#You are near the northern edge of the Styx river; a high, expansive ceiling looming above you.  Even on the river, you can hear (or feel) a rumbling in the distance; seeming to make the river water vibrate with tiny waves.#Subterranean Cove.#You are in a subterranean cove, on the edge of a massive cavern.  A soft glow shines off the walls, making artificial light unnecessary here.  Interestingly, the walls seem to emit deep vibrations which coincide with a distant rumbling sound.  To the north, you see a wide river flowing by; running from the northwest to southeast.  Across the river, you can make out the shape of the northern shoreline; the cavern continuing further than the eye can see.  An old shroud hangs conspicuously on the stone wall, creating a lifelike silhouette.#Attic.#This is a dark attic, buried in dust and cobwebs.  In the far corner you can make out the shape of an old chest.  A broken-down doorway leads out to the west but the doorway is blocked by a large pile of debris, making passage impossible.  A stairway leads down into darkness.#Aft Deck.#You are on the aft deck of the cutter; with the position behind the ship's steering wheel providing a clear, unobstructed view beyond the ship's bow. Next to a rear-mounted canon there is a powder locker, firmly attached to the deck. An opening in the deck leads down to a cargo hold, and a doorway provides an entrance into the ship's cabin.#Ship's Cabin.#You are in the cabin of the ship, a small compartment furnished with cots and a built-in cupboard.  In such cramped quarters it's clear that this was only used for sleeping and shelter.  A doorway leads out to the south.#floorboard#Near the center of the room, a floorboard sits beside a hole in the floor.#There's a deep covering of dust on the floor; but near the center, you can see what appears to be the lip of a slightly raised floorboard.#There's a deep covering of dust on the floor; but near the center of the room, you see a hole in the floor with a floorboard sitting next to it.#gold key#It's a gold key with intricate carvings.#hole#grimy skeleton#    A grimy skeleton, laying face down in the dirt.#The skeleton has a very sad look on his face; he must be unhappy.#Strangely, the skeleton seems to have a smile on his boney face.#stone cross#The stone cross looks like it has some writing on it.#The stone cross says:@ @        Bless our dear brother William@             May he rot in HELL@#slab of granite#The slab of granite is large and heavy.#The slab has been pushed aside, revealing an opening in the western wall.#hole#A hole is embedded in the ground, leading into a shadowy darkness.#marble coffin#The coffin is made of marble which has a subtle yellow tone.
