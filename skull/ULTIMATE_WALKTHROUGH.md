> 
> I'm afraid the convulsions that brought about the death of Charles could only have come from the world of spirits.
> 
> I've locked many of the rooms with hammer and nail, for the ghost has been rampant in them. Most of the servants have deserted the house; I'm afraid they fear the death of convulsions that killed poor Charles. It's scary, but I don't know what to do."
